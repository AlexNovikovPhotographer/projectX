Infographic analysis 

Firstly I see the name in the top left so I instantly get what this info is about. After that
I notice the main shape - it reminds of classic story structure - beginning, culmination and final.
All the additional shapes and colours make me follow the right order of reading blocks. The font size shows
hierarchy. Pointers under the bump obviously show how the way of shortening the path. Overall feeling
of scrutinizing the infographics is perfect.
Combining huge amount of information in a small diagram seems incredible.
